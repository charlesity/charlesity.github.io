## About me (Education Background)
I am a computer scientist doing research in AI/ML. I am also interested in enterprise software development. I have a Bachelor's of technology, a Masters degree and a Ph.D all in computer science. 

## About me (Career)
My research spans probabilistic parametric/non-parametric models - (e.g, Bayesian DNN, Gaussian processes), Active learning and Software designs.
I currently work as a faculty member in the department of computer science at Baze University, Abuja, where I teach and do research in topics relating to Machine learning, algorithms and complexity, optimization, distributed systems and computer programming in various sequential and parallel programming languages. I also provide expert knowledge via consultancy in software development and AI related projects. Prior to that I worked with Bingham university as a faculty member and I have done a few projects on and off the educational space.

## About me (Leisure)
I love music! I find it relaxing to listen to good music and also play a few musical instruments. I would also say that I see coding and doing a few mathematics  relaxing, so you might find me doing these as a form of relaxation.
