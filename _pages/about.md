## About me (Education Background)
I am a computer scientist doing research in AI/ML and enterprise software development. I have a Bachelor's of technology, a Masters and a Ph.D degree all in computer science. 

## About me (Career)
My research spans probabilistic parametric/non-parametric models - (e.g, Bayesian DNN, Gaussian processes) using active learning. My works have span application areas ranging from computer vision to audio and national language processes. More recently I have been tilted towards research in large multimodal learning and its applications therein. I am currently a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at Baze University, Abuja, where I teach and do research in topics relating to Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, algorithms and complexity, optimization, distributed systems, and computer programming in various sequential and parallel programming languages. I also provide expert knowledge via consultancy in AI-related and software development projects. Before that, I worked with Bingham University as a faculty member and I have done a few projects on and off the educational space.

## About me (Leisure)
I love listening to good music regardless of the genre and I also play the guitar and keyboard sometimes. I also enjoy 'writing codings', reading mathematics/physics articles, and watching science documentaries. I actually find these activities relaxing, so dont be surprise if you find me doing any of them as a form of relaxation.
